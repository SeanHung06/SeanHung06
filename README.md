I am a graduate student in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I worked as a Software Engineer for 3+ years and also interned at SoFi 2024 Summer in San Fransico, where I focused on developing data pipelines using Java Spring Boot. 

Throughout my career, I dedicated myself to various projects, including performing a significant version upgrade of a Corporate banking core system with Java and PL/SQL. Additionally, I have contributed to the cloud industry as a Cloud Engineer, specializing in AWS and participating in implementing a Data Analytics Platform using Python and AWS services.

"With Knowledge We Serve" is my life motto and that is the reason why I am passionate about the problems Computer Science can solve. The endless possibilities of software innovation inspire me to continually learn, develop, and apply technological solutions for the betterment of society. My drive is fueled by the belief that with each line of code, I can contribute to a larger purpose â€” creating impactful change and fostering progress.
